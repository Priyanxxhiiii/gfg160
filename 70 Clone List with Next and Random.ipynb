    "Construct a copy of this linked list. The copy should consist of the same number of new nodes, where each new node has the value corresponding to its original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list, such that it also represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.\n",
